Who is in PED? It is an energy stock! I am in at xxxx shares. It has potential and room to grow!,"
Today it had a run. It is an energy stock. Here is info from their website.

We are an exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. We target legacy conventional proven properties where there is a long production history, well-defined geology and existing infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field management.

Our current properties are located in the San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas and eastern New Mexico and in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (D-J Basin) in Colorado in the Wattenberg core and extension area. We have approximately 41,700 net Permian Basin acres located in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, and approximately 12,000 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado.

Our goal is to be the operator in the majority of our acreage so that we can dictate the pace of development and maintain capital discipline.

Strategic Focus

Become the Premier Public Oil &amp;amp; Gas Company Focused on the Development of Conventional Assets Using Unconventional Technologies
Maximize Value of our Permian and D-J Basin Assets
Primary focus will be to grow reserves and production on our Permian Basin properties through low-risk horizontal San Andres infill drilling
Secondary focus will be on our D-J Basin properties where offset operators have used improving completion techniques with larger fracs to drive strong 30-day average initial production rates (IP30) and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) growth
Build a team of highly skilled employees to facilitate growth and successful implementation of our plans
Maintain Strong Balance Sheet with Financial Flexibility
History

Prior to June 2018, PEDEVCO focused primarily on development of its properties in the D-J Basin and had accumulated $73.4 million in debt through the oil downturn of 2014 - 2017 and was in danger of losing its NYSE American listing.

On June 26, 2018, the Company secured a strategic investment of $7.7 million from SK Energy LLC, an investment company owned by Dr. Simon Kukes, who subsequently became PEDEVCO's Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company on July 12, 2018. At this time a new management team who had been working with Dr. Kukes on the restructuring and other oil and gas acquisitions was brought into the company. Through a series of restructuring transactions, all outstanding liabilities were eliminated, and SK Energy became owner of 47% of the common shares outstanding.

The result of the restructuring was a simplified balance sheet, a significant reduction in indebtedness, and insertion of a new management team with a new corporate and enhanced operational focus.

On August 31, 2018, the Company closed the acquisition of the Chaveroo and Milnesand fields in Permian Basin of New Mexico, for $21.3 million. These properties consist of over 23,000 acres, held by production (HBP'd), of mostly contiguous land and have been active oil producing fields since the 1960's. The new management team had previously evaluated these fields and used PEDEVCO as the vehicle to acquire and implement their new strategy.

On February 4, 2019 the Company acquired approximately 22,000 additional leasehold acres in the Chaveroo NE field which is contiguous with the Company's Chaveroo field.

$PROG - The Next Big Short Squeeze Candidate,"Alright retards, I can't believe I happened upon this but **$PROG** has every bit of momentum that it needs to skyrocket AND IT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED IN THE MAINSTREAM YET. WE'RE STILL EARLY

Let's first to *compare it to CEI for squeeze-potential context*. Then we'll *look at some shorting statistics to see how much momentum this thing REALLY has behind it. Third we'll look at BIG catalysts that would send the price up anyways. Finally as a cherry on top, we'll look at recent purchases from institutions* 

**Comparison to a recent short squeeze**: *$PROG is following the exact chart pattern for $CEI and the TA is indicating that we're only at the beginning for this ride*

[Had the same pullback at $2. Ended up going to overbought conditions before a pullback from $4.60. Went up to 5B OBV](https://preview.redd.it/cbejaa2ovvq71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99ccc44cc7392476ac35f5efc8244c5d3665889)

[Still has huge momentum and ways to go. Not anywhere near the RSI range that $CEI reached. Fraction of the OBV vs $CEI.](https://preview.redd.it/8e5zp69iwvq71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef9cb24cd7c3a2331031de341cec6e65024b3c7)

# Catalysts - DD by /u/caddude420 (link to his post below)

* **(1) There are a bunch of catalysts in Q4**.  And Q4 starts on Friday (Oct 1st), so the entire month of October and  beyond should be insane. Especially with Preecludia news. Q4 Catalysts  are:  

   * Preecludia - publication &amp; parternship ongoing efforts
   * Single-molecule NIPT optimization
   * PGN-OB2 - pre-IND meeting with FDA
   * GI/Pharma - topline clinical PK/PD for adalimumab in ulcerative collitis
   * Better  Q4 financials - since the company shifted focus, they have said  themselves that operating expenses will be cut down by 70%.

&amp;#x200B;

Q4 Catalysts.

* **(2) Analyst price target - $3.50 (294.68% upside)** \- acccording to [tipranks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/prog/forecast). However, this is only based on 2 wall street analysts in the last 3 months.
* **(3)** **Short interest**  \- sometimes having high short interest is a catalyst on it's own.  People often buy shorted stocks without doing any DD just because it's  shorted.
* **(4)** **Possibility of more insider buying** \- Athyrium capital has a history of buying PROG (see Part 5). And according to [whalewisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/athyrium-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link), PROG is their biggest holding (35% of their portfolio), they hold 73 million shares with a market value of 60 million.  

   * In  general, Athyrium seeks to invest $25 million to $150 million per  transaction with the ability to scale-up opportunistically on select  investments ([link](https://www.athyrium.com/criteria.php)).
* **(5)** **Rumors of acquisition**  

   * **Athyrium has a history of helping biotech companies set up to be bought out/acquired.**
   * **Example 1 with Verenium** \- *""On  September 20, 2013, Verenium announced that it had entered into an  agreement to be acquired by BASF Corporation. The all-cash tender offer  of $4.00 per share represented a 56% premium to the volume-weighted  average closing price of Verenium’s common stock in the previous six  months. ""* This all occurred after they helped grow the company where they launched three different enzyme products. ([link](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php))
   * **Example 2 with Biofire** \- *""On  September 4, 2013, bioMérieux SA announced that it had entered into an  agreement to acquire 100% of BioFire for a $450M acquisition price plus  BioFire’s net financial debt. After government approvals, the merger  closed on January 16, 2014. Athyrium’s term loan was repaid and warrants  exercised.""* And again, this all occurred after Biofire grew as a company and they eventually got FDA approval for one of their panels. ([link](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-biofire.php))
   * Right  now, PROG is currently in a period of growth and with Athyrium's help  they will grow as a company and then there is a high chance that they  will be acquired right after, especially with Athyrium owning 67%  according to the 14C. We have so many catalysts in Q4 and beyond, so  this is very likely in the long term rather than the short term. So this  is a good buying opportunity for both investors and traders that want  to benefit from the squeeze.
   * Just look at Athyrium's approach on their website. Their [criteria](https://www.athyrium.com/criteria.php), [philosophy](https://www.athyrium.com/philosophy.php), [structured capital](https://www.athyrium.com/structured-capital.php), look good to me. They are a fund that knows their shit and holds positions long-term.
* **(6) Rumors of being the next ""$CEI""**  

   * Right  now penny land is going crazy. We saw CEI go from 35 cents all the way  to over $3 in a month. PROG and CEI have two similarities in common,  both were shorted to oblivion (possibly due to how the company was ran  at the time), and both companies now have new CEO's and a change in the  direction of the company. PROG is now being seen as a sympathy to CEI  but I believe both can run at the same time. I should note however that I  do own CEI.
* **(7) Gap-fill**  \- to all of those heavy on technical analysis, PROG has a gapfill all  the way to $1.45, that is a 63% increase from the price that it is  currently trading at. The saying goes, that all gaps need to be filled  eventually.

$PROG daily chart.

* **(8) October Conference.**  The company will participate in the 11th annual Partnership  Opportunities in Drug Delivery (PODD) Conference, October 28-29, 2021 in  Boston.

# Institutional Buying

[ Currently, there are no signs of institutional selling. Only buys. The last purchase was by Athyrium Capital, where they purchased  $46 million in stock in June when the stock was trading at about $2.50. ](https://preview.redd.it/1ls18iku2wq71.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=817af803000a336282d65c13c25989c79f8f7173)

I shoulda posted yday it had a pretty insane run. But PROG has recieved lots of attention lately in the news as a potential short squeeze candidate. Good price predictions for long term as well

I am currently in 5 2$ calls for 10/15 EXP, might sell and just buy equity.

Also side note other stocks reddits like r/Shortsqueeze have been wildin over this stock.

Price analysis shows potentially upwards of 6$ by the end of the month ( not so penny stock then )

Currently its dipping, I believe it may be a good time to enter.

Fidelity cut off trading of CEI to stave off a potential short squeeze,"This week I read a Business Insider article that highlighted 5 stonks with high short squeeze potential. My dick got hard, because they were all cheap so I bought a share of each (ATER, CEI, MRIN, BBIG, KPLT), but Fidelity blocked CEI so I bought it on RH. Of the 5, CEI is the only one that went up. It could be a shit company ( I bought in at $3.09 so I’m not going to lose much), but Fidelity was scared enough to halt trading and it reminded me of another squeeze that got a lot more attention.

Not a recommendation, just reminiscing. I won’t be out that much if they tank",2021-09-29 19:01:23+00:00,1,1

$USWS looks very similar to $CEI before the run.,"I have found that $USWS matches best with sympathy to $CEI. Both pennies that ran on similar days. Daily charts look near identical. We haven't seen a single sympathy despite $CEI 500% run.

&amp;#x200B;

\- $USWS has a short float of 20%+ like $CEI 

\- US based penny energy company focused on natural gas and electrical systems similar to $CEI

\- $USWS Massive squeezer candidate with a large 20% short float 1.60-2.00+ PT

&amp;#x200B;

Massive unseen volume from $CEI and I have a strong feeling that volume will shift towards $USWS they had always ran together in the past back in Feb 2021.

[If you look at the green circle when $CEI broke over 200sma \(White line\) 1.00 it squeeze massively.](https://preview.redd.it/2y323ck0z9q71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9e1eff71655f3b9e420beb385c7425470b42b21)

&amp;#x200B;

Same thing with $USWS. Nearing that 1.00 mark 200sma. Once $USWS breaks over 1.00. Massive squeeze trigger for shorts there.

$SHIP - The Next Great Mover," 

The demand for getting stuff shipped  is sky high and through the roof literally. As more and more pent demand  continues to grow it will become a growing issue and concern which is  something that most will neglect. 

Macro vs. Micro comes into play

Many  don't realize that individuals and company's are willing to pay  thousands in extra costs simply to get their product first, let alone on  time. The delays are staggering and names like Home Depot, Costco and  others continue to add billion dollar contracts. This is all while the $BDI (Bultic Dry Index) is pushing decade highs. 

It is clear that volume continues to ramp and churn. This is crucial as stocks get trapped and push higher. Look at $CEI and the move they are experiencing for example. Each level of consolidation leads to another push, churn and leg higher. $SHIP is no different. Monster action over $1 and now a huge churn is happening at $1.50 that could become the huge catalyst for a move towards $2.50/$5/$10 in time. Pent demand will soon produce a wave of activity that could send this in mulit-bagger territory.

Camber Energy (CEI) DD,"# 1. About Camber Energy

Camber energy is a unknown clean energy stock founded in 2003. It is currently up 350 percent this month. currently at around 1.50 dollars a share, it has recently gotten a patent for a carbon capture device. Mainly doing clean energy, they are a good long term investment. But you retards arent patient, so here is some more info: about 25 percent of shares are public, and that number is going down. They have between 100- 60 million volume a day, but that is also going down.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Short Term Gains?!?!

Camber energy has seen a record breaking month, but it seems to be evening out. only about 1 percent of share are short sold, giving it a good postion to squeeze.  Now this combined with the fact that their a whale has recently put 15 million in shares without the stock changing, means its at the brink of explosian. It also has had about a week straight of losses, puting it lower the its value. I think all of this means it is a good short term investment.

Future of $CEI," Camber Energy secured a patent last month and since then the stock price has done very well.  Trading is well above 50 dma and 200 dma.

This technology will change the world! They claim;  The ESG system is truly unique with the ability to create a Net Zero carbon outcome from a conventional, natural gas, internal combustion engine without loss of efficiency.

How amazing is that! Please take the time to read the article &amp; I look forward to your replies.

 

The stock price of Camber Energy Inc (NYSEAMERICAN: CEI) significantly increased in the middle of the trading day. This was around the time that a major announcement was made that affects the company. 

ESG Clean Energy, LLC (ESG) — developers of Net Zero Carbon Footprints and clean energy solutions for distributed power generation — had announced today it has signed a licensing deal with Viking Energy Group (OTCQB: VKIN), a majority-owned subsidiary of Camber Energy, Inc. (NYSE Amex: CEI), for exclusive rights to use ESG’s CO2-free power generation technology in all of Canada.

This agreement allows Viking to use ESG’s patent rights and know-how related to stationary electric power generation, including methods to utilize heat and capture carbon dioxide. And the license is exclusive for all of Canada (unlimited number of systems), and non-exclusive for up to twenty-five locations in the United States.

This ESG Clean Energy System is designed for generating clean electricity from internal combustion engines and utilize waste heat to capture ⁓ 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the engine without loss of efficiency, and in a manner to facilitate the production of precious commodities (e.g. distilled/ de-ionized water; UREA (NH4); ammonia (NH3); ethanol; and methanol) for sale.

The ESG system is truly unique with the ability to create a Net Zero carbon outcome from a conventional, natural gas, internal combustion engine without loss of efficiency. And the exhaust gas contains a significant amount of water vapor and CO2 as naturally occurring byproducts of the combustion process. By separating those 2 elements, the ESG system can produce distilled water and other commodities. As a result, the Net Zero Carbon Footprint power production is achieved.

Besides electrical power generation, the ESG system can be utilized in a number of different environments, including:

— Plastics Recycling Operations – This could be made more affordable and safer for the environment by providing low-cost, CO2-free heat that is critical to its processing.

— Nitrogen Removal – This could be done more efficiently and cleanly. Nitrogen can cause algae blooms in wastewater treatment plants and is a risk to human health, so its removal has become an emerging, worldwide concern.

— Stranded Natural Gas Wells – Could be effectively converted from non-operating revenue producers to operating revenue producers by incorporating the ESG system into its production process.

— Microgrids – Could be made more reliable in times of emergency with the distributed power abilities of ESG power generation when regional grids go down.

— Data Centers – Could provide large data centers with clean low-cost energy in a relatively small package

.

It is also worth mentioning that CEI is favored by investors on social media platforms like Reddit, StockTwits, Discord, Twitter, etc. And CEI is often targeted for short squeezes. And so the company stock price is up about 150% over the past month.

**KEY QUOTE:**

*“Securing a license arrangement on this scale is a major milestone for ESG Clean Energy. This agreement enables ESG to not only expand our power generation business, but also allows us to provide more effective energy solutions outside the United States by leveraging the experience, expertise and relationships within the entire Viking and Camber organization.”*

**— Nick Scuderi, president of ESG Clean Energy**

"$CEI ""DD"" Q´s on Camber Energy","I know many are sceptical towards Camber Energy due to sketchy behaviour in the past... Nonetheless, it is sky-rocketing up more than 130% over the last 10 days...

So In my view, all very plausible explanations for the up-tick....

#CEI (Camber Energy) very bullish catalysts,"They're redefining mining by making energy use more efficient using a newly patented ""carbon capture energy model.""

The carbon capture model is also 100% clean, capturing all CO2.

This is from their website:

The ESG Clean Energy System is designed to generate clean electricity from internal combustion engines and utilize waste heat to capture ⁓ 100%of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the engine without loss of efficiency, and in a manner to facilitate the production of precious commodities (e.g. distilled/ de-ionized water; UREA (NH4); ammonia (NH3); ethanol; and methanol) for sale.

They're based in Texas, which after China's ban, many miners have set up shop. 

Correlation to mining growth which is still very bullish despite volatility.

Strong buy, I got in a bit late averaging at .94/share. They're in a consolidation period now and still on sale.

This is not financial advise rather a well educated opinion.

Is there some sort of relationship anyone can find between major stakeholders or top management of the company and the Biden / Obama administrations?

IDEX continues to surprise me with the cost per share with the type of business they are building for the future with EVs. Tractors/street sweepers/motorcycles/public transportation. Could see a huge boost from Biden's infrastructure bill.  
ZOM recently released their first product in March I believe. Earnings should see positive growth and bump this puppy up a bit.  


I will play these as swings and watch for the pop before/after earnings and adjust the sell accordingly.  


Any opinions related good or bad are welcome, thanks everyone!

"Why $CEI, a penny oil stock, will run with crude oil prices.","OPEC+ has not been able to come to a deal yet regarding oil supply, therefore they are still only producing the amount of oil required during the pandemic. With this summer's huge increase in oil demand and limited supply, the Brent and WTI crude oil prices have reached all time highs. Camber Energy (CEI) has shown the ability to move with the crude oil price as we saw last Thursday 7/1/21. It is a bottomed-out play with a recent history of running over 200% in a matter of days. I encourage you to check it, OPEC+ has no meeting to discuss increasing supply which tells us that an oil price war is coming. This is good for us and the oilers, bad for the local college student filling up on gas every week. However, money always wins in the end and they know how to make money in the Middle East.

Camber Energy (CEI) is looking tasty,"They have been creeping upwards.  

They have a merger in the near-term works with a profitable company (Viking) and it seems it will go through since Camber replaced their CEO with the CEO of Viking (James Doris).

They have earnings coming up June 29th and will be able to add 62% (or 100% if the merger happens before) of Vikings earnings to their balance sheet (is that how this works..?)

They’re working on filing paperwork to put themselves in good standings on the NYSE (assume within the month)

They are dirt cheap right now.

Maybe Time To Short Firms That Do Business In China,"Fathom's China Exposure Index (CEI) measures the performance of US-listed firms that do business in China relative to that of their peers. Since the beginning of April, CEI has declined sharply amid China's credit growth moderating, Beijing's crackdown on Alibaba founder Jack Ma, and escalating tensions between the US and China. 

Firms in the CEI derive between 15% and 85% of their revenues from China. Pinpointing the exact cause of the April dump of US-listed firms with earnings highly correlated to Chinese economic activity is not entirely known. 

*Processing img xwqwmozyndu61...*

 At this rate, the country's ""credit impulse, or the change of new credit as a percentage of GDP, could start to shrink by July or August just as the Fed may lay the groundwork for its own tapering,"" said Bloomberg's Ye Xie notes. This confirms what we've discussed over the last couple of months. 

https://preview.redd.it/k2r1kxe4odu61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd7328659a50f2c4f375266fd62612e307122c35

Further, escalating tensions between US and China were exhibited at China's flagship business event, Boao Forum for Asia, on Tuesday when President Xi Jinping called for new world order. He cautioned US global leadership and warned against economic decoupling. 

&gt;*""International affairs should be handled by everyone,"" Xi said. He did not name the US in his speech but directed comments at Washington's efforts to decouple supply chains from Asia.*   
*""The rules set by one or several countries should not be imposed on others, and the unilateralism of individual countries should not give the whole world a rhythm,"" he said.*

The latest dump in the CEI could even be the start of the trickle-down effects of china's credit impulse impacting global assets, simultaneously, the US is in the process of decoupling some of its supply chains. ",2021-04-20 19:14:06+00:00,1,1

"For the eighth consecutive year, GameStop earns 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s annual assessment of LGBTQ workplace equality index","From Gamestops Investor Relations news page on Jan 28th:

I REALLY LIKE THIS COMPANY AND I LIKE HOLDING THEIR STOCK!

The Article, Copy/Pasta:

 GRAPEVINE, Texas, Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop proudly announced today that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality. This marks the eighth consecutive year that GameStop has earned top marks in the annual workplace campaign.  


“Receiving this award and designation as a *Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality* is an honor for GameStop,” says George Sherman, chief executive officer for GameStop. “Our values compel us to be the voice, commit to inclusion, and personify respect. At GameStop, we act on this through championing causes for the LGBTQ community, and all those committed to improving and protecting the rights of every human.”

“From the previously unimaginable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to a long overdue reckoning with racial injustice, 2020 was an unprecedented year. Yet, many businesses across the nation stepped up and continued to prioritize and champion LGBTQ equality,” said Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President. “This year has shown us that tools like the CEI are crucial in the work to increase equity and inclusion in the workplace, but also that companies must breathe life into these policies and practices in real and tangible ways. Thank you to the companies that understand protecting their LGBTQ employees and consumers from discrimination is not just the right thing to do—but the best business decision.”

The results of the 2021 CEI showcase how 1,142 U.S.-based companies are not only promoting LGBTQ-friendly workplace policies in the U.S., but also for the 57% of CEI-rated companies with global operations who are helping advance the cause of LGBTQ inclusion in workplaces abroad. GameStop’s efforts in satisfying all of the CEI’s criteria earned a 100 percent ranking and the designation as one of the *Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality*.

The CEI rates employers providing these crucial protections to over 18 million U.S. workers and an additional 17 million abroad. Companies rated in the CEI include Fortune magazine’s 500 largest publicly traded businesses, American Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (AmLaw 200), and hundreds of publicly and privately held mid- to large-sized businesses.

The CEI rates companies on detailed criteria falling under four central pillars:

* Non-discrimination policies across business entities
* Equitable benefits for LGBTQ workers and their families
* Supporting an inclusive culture
* Corporate social responsibility

What’s the deal with $CEI?,"I know I’m going to lose half of you autists because it’s not options. But what in the H-E-double-Fuck is going on with CIE... started at over $100,000 per share and is now at $0.20..?! Back in April it spiked back to $200ish and held for a full month.
